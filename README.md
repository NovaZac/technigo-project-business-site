# Business Site
The assignment was to create a business one-pager website and i choose to make one where users can book appointments for various dog services. The primary focus was on practicing HTML forms, with additional elements like an image header to enhance the design.

I started by planning the layout, emphasizing user-friendly navigation. The core feature was the booking form, where users could select different dog services. Where I added radio buttons, different labels, and a submit button. For example input fields for specific details like service type and appointment time.

With more time, I would among other things implement validation error messages to provide helpful feedback when required fields are not filled in correctly.
